# Lava-figure
This application was my laboratory works for discipline computer graphics. 
In fact, this is the conclusion of the figure that I got on the job, to which
I applied the texture of the lava. We can look at it in the mode of free flight 
of the 3d camera. Here I use many third-party libraries. There was glew, glfw3,
SOIL, glm and some code in such files "ReadShaders.h", "FPSCamera.h" from this
